## MPipeline.run()
The `run()` function is the core inference method of the MPipeline class. It transforms input text into synthesized speech using a two-stage pipeline: text-to-semantic conversion followed by semantic-to-speech synthesis.

Here's a breakdown of its key operations:

1. **Parameter Processing**:
   - Extracts and validates input parameters (text, language, reference audio path, etc.)
   - Configures inference settings (batch size, temperature, top-k, etc.)
   - Sets up processing modes (parallel inference, fragment return, etc.)

2. **Reference Voice Setup**:
   - Loads and processes reference audio to capture the target voice characteristics
   - Handles prompt text if provided to guide the synthesis

3. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Segments the input text using the specified method
   - Converts text to phonetic and linguistic features
   - Organizes the data into batches for efficient processing

4. **Semantic Token Generation**:
   - Uses the Text2Semantic model to convert text features into semantic tokens
   - Applies sampling techniques (temperature, top-k, top-p) to control generation

5. **Audio Synthesis**:
   - Feeds semantic tokens into the VITS model to generate audio waveforms
   - Handles both standard and V3 model variants with different synthesis approaches
   - Supports parallel or sequential processing based on configuration

6. **Post-processing**:
   - Concatenates audio fragments with appropriate intervals
   - Applies speed modification if requested
   - Optionally performs super-sampling for higher audio quality
   - Formats the audio for output

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Manages exceptions and ensures proper cleanup
   - Returns empty audio in case of failures
   - Resets models when necessary to prevent memory leaks

The function operates as a generator, yielding audio samples either:
- All at once when `return_fragment=False`
- Fragment by fragment when `return_fragment=True`

Each yield returns a tuple containing the sample rate and audio waveform data.
